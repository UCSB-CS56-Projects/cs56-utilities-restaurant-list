a)The program allows users to enter in an address then displays nearby restaurants. Users can sort by type of cuisine, along with being able to add restaurants to their choosing.

b) You can look up restaurants based on the type of food they serve, the times they are open, and plan when you’re going to go.

c)The program runs correctly, albeit very buggy. You can look up restaurants, add a new restaurant, create and save from CSV file, and look up restaurant based on opening and closing times.

d) The user interface is very annoying and jerky and could use some cleaning up. The opening times for every restaurant is set at 8-10 and could be fixed. An option to add a price range would be cool. 

e) Compatible OS’s, An explanation of how to build the project,

f)The Javadoc is missing descriptions for many classes and methods. All the target descriptions are there.

g) We can definitely earn 1000 points. Most of the issues just involve making the system run smoother.

h) We can make the interface more user friendly by changing the background.

i) The conde is very easy to understand as it is well organized. Each part has their objectives clearly stated. Each class relates to each other pretty obviously also, with clear comments. Most of the code relates to the Yelp API, relaying parameters to it and getting responses. If  I had to show this code to new people with a page of text, I would just suggest to read the comments and the names of the methods. 

j) This part is pretty lacking, as there are no JUnit tests. However, we can easily make our own.
