a) The program allows users to add and browse restaurants using a database. The two main classifications of a restaurant are the hours of operation and the cusine.


b) As a customer, I can check the hours of the restaurant so that I make sure that when I do go it is open.
   As a customer, I can check the phone number of the restaurant to contact them about other question I have.
   As a customer, I can browse restaurants by cuisine so that I have narrower list of options within my preference.
   As a restaurant owner, I can add information to the database so that customers are aware of the information regarding my restaurant.

c) The current software runs. It brings up a menu of options including eat, add a new restaurant, create and save from CSV file, and look up restaurant based on hours of operation.

d) As a customer, I want to browse by price range so that I only see restaurants that are within my budget.
   As a customer, I want to filter restaurants by diet restriction such as vegetarian or vegan so that I know the menu corresponds further with my needs.
   As a restaurant owner, I want to be able to set hours for individual days so that I have have variable open and close times.
   As a restaurant owner, I want to add menu items when creating an entry so that customers have specific information about the restaurant's cuisune.
   As a customer, I want to be to add without creating dublication.
   
e) The README.md should mention that the app allows users to search for places to eat based on preferences such as hours of operation and cuisine. It does not display all the restaurants in the database at once.

f) All the targets have descriptions. The class path to JUnit is still in JWS format. We can change this by downloading the JUnit test and put it inside a lib directory in our working directory, then push it onto github.

g) The current issues include adding the ability to edit entries, adding the ability to save images, and integrating with the Yelp API. The issues, espeically the last one is involved enough to give us enough work and challenge. The explanations are clear enough for us to start working
