```
 W16 | pconrad 4pm | thienhoang23,Brenda_Flores | improves the app to integrate YelpAPI to generate the database and fix multiple bugs on add restaurants and eat features of the GUI
```

Implementing this app is a great way to learn about API, networking, and simple GUI. I have highlighted the areas in GUI file that could use a major improvement (mostly the editting feature). A confusing thing about this lab is that the eat method will only show the restaurants openned during real time. So if you are coding at night, you might not see a lot of restaurants on your eat list and confused it with a bug. Also worth noticing is that even though Yelp API greatly increases the usability of the app, it, however, does not provide the operation hours of the businesses. If you could find a second API and cross refernce them with Yelp, that would boost this app's usability immensely. A little hint: You could add image into of the restaurant in in its info because when I first generated the restaurants database, I have included the imageURL into each restaurant. Lastly, just a suggestion, if you could move all the directories around and rename in a more logical way, that would be great!
